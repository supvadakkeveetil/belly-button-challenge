# belly-button-challenge
## Project Description:
The challenge is to create a Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard enabling a select option to choose the ID # and display the respective charts for the ID#
#### Dataset
Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset contains data on Microbes that colonize the human navel
" The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare."

### Demographics



### Bar Chart

##### Horizontal Bar chart to display the Top 10 OTU's found in the individual selected
